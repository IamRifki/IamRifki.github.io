                <h3>Preface</h3>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin">Odin</a> is a programming language created by <a
                        href="http://gingerbill.org">gingerBill</a>.
                </p>
                <p>It's a very good language and I recommend checking it out.</p>
                <p>
                    One of the highlights of this language in my opinion is its Syntax, which looks a bit weird at
                    first, but once you actually write in it, it feels <span class="highlight">natural</span> so to
                    speak.
                </p>
                <h3>Examples</h3>
                <p>
                    Take this for example:
                </p>
                <div class="code-body">

                    <pre><span class="code-block-title">Odin</span><code class="lolight">import "core:fmt"

foo :: proc() {
    fmt.println("bar");
}</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Notice two things about it, the <span class="highlight">::</span> operator and the name <span
                        class="highlight">proc</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike in C++, the <span class="highlight">::</span> operator does not mean scope resolution,
                    instead, it is used to denote the type of in this case a <span class="highlight">proc</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    in most languages procedures are called functions, and they are usually defined like:
                </p>
                <div class="code-body">

                    <pre><span class="code-block-title">C</span> <code class="lolight">void foo() {
    printf("bar");
}</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>or:</p>
                <div class="code-body">

                    <pre><span class="code-block-title">Clojure</span><code class="lolight">(defn -foo
    [& args]
    (println "bar"))</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Calling what other languages call functions "procedures" may look like it's just trying to break the
                    C tradition, but there is a <a href="https://odin-lang.org/docs/faq/#why-is-it-named-proc">real
                        explanation said by gingerBill himself</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    in Odin the <span class="highlight">::</span> operator not only denotes procedures but also <span
                        class="highlight">constants and structs</span>.
                </p>
                <div class="code-body">

                    <pre><span class="code-block-title">Odin</span><code class="lolight">/* constants */
foo :: 123;
bar : int : 123;

/* variables */
foo := 123;
bar : int = 123;</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In the constants examples, <span class="highlight">foo</span>'s value is untyped and <span
                        class="highlight">bar</span>'s value is typed. You do not need to type them, they also serve as
                    the equivalent of a C macro, so instead of this in C:
                </p>
                <div class="code-body">
                    <pre><span class="code-block-title">C</span><code class="lolight">#define CONSTANT 123</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In Odin, you would write:
                </p>
                <div class="code-body">

                    <pre><span class="code-block-title">Odin</span><code class="lolight">CONSTANT :: 123;
</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In the variable examples, <span class="highlight">foo</span> and <span class="highlight">bar</span>
                    both
                    have the same type despite being written differently, this is
                    because of Odin has type inference similar to Go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Structs example:
                </p>
                <div class="code-body">

                    <pre><span class="code-block-title">Odin</span><code class="lolight">foo :: struct {
    bar: f32,
    baz: f32,
}</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    and the list continues.
                </p>
                <h3>Opinions / My experience with Odin</h3>
                <p>
                    At first, I do find this a bit jarring, coming from languages like C, Go, Python, Lisp, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    but, as I used the language more, the syntax feels <span class="highlight">natural</span>, as I said
                    earlier.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Language design is an interesting topic that I would like to explore again some time, I have written
                    a programming language before, but I really didn't like how the syntax turned out. Odin proves that
                    a single man with some help can design a language and exceed other languages by at least a mile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope this article can raise awareness to Odin and why it's interesting, until next time, see you
                    all around.
