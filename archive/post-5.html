                <h3>Preface</h3>
                <p>
                    Haskell is a functional programming language, it means it's not an imperative programming language
                    like C for example.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Haskell is very interesting to me because instead of telling the computer what it should do, instead
                    you tell it abstract things about the things it should do, I'll explain in the next section.
                </p>
                <h3>Main :: IO ()</h3>
                <p>
                    Let's talk about how an imperative programmer would implement walking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imperative programmers would say that walking is moving, but Haskell programmers would say that
                    Walking is moving each feet in front of the other feet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a bit nonsense at first, but as you program in Haskell more, it seems natural.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Haskell (when used correctly) also reduces the amount of code written, let's take a look at some
                    Examples.
                </p>
                <h3>Examples</h3>

bool isPrime(int);

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    int primes = 10000, count = 0;
    if (argc > 1) {
    primes = atoi(argv[1]);
    }
    if (isPrime(2)) {
    count++;
    }
    for (int i = 3; i <= primes; i+=2) {
        if (isPrime(i)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    cout << count << endl;
    return 0;

bool isPrime(int x){
    for (int i = 2; i <= floor(sqrt(x)); i++) {
        if (x % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;

                <p>
                    Now, that doesn't look long for the average imperative programmer, but let's take a look at the
                    Haskell example.
                </p>

        go q | q <= isqrt x = if rem x q == 0 then False else go (q+2)

                    <p>
                        That's way nicer and cleaner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall the code in Haskell is much cleaner, readable, and takes less time to code.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        I hope this post convinces you to at least check out other Haskell articles. This language is
                        very interesting at its core and It has sparked me to create a program in it (you can view it on
                        GitHub).
                    </p>
