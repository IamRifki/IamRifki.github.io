          <h3>Prelude</h3>
          <p>
            When I was starting JavaScript in Node.js 3 years ago, I never
            really liked it, the package management is awful, with this weird
            <span class="highlight">package.lock</span> system, and it
            unfortunately carried over to languages like Rust.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I first heard about Deno, I wasn't all that thrilled, at first
            it just looked like a rewrite of Node.js in Rust, but I checked it
            even more and now I see it as a replacement for Node and a saviour
            to people who are frustrated with Node.
          </p>
          <h3>A bit of history</h3>
          <p>
            Deno and Node.js were made by the same person, Ryan Dahl. He
            originally created Node to make so that the backend and frontend of
            an application can be written in one language, which in itself is a
            good thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            However Dahl made a lot of wrong decisions and Node has become
            infamous for callback hell, and the messy NPM package management
            which encourages a billion small packages like
            <span class="highlight">is-number</span> to pop up, and this caused
            a lot of problem when the
            <a
              href="https://www.davidhaney.io/npm-left-pad-have-we-forgotten-how-to-program/"
              >left-pad package came around and was removed from the NPM
              registry</a
            >, causing the
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW-SOdj4Kkk"
              >first signs of the collapse of civilization</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually in Dahl's 2018 talk
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA"
              >10 Things I Regret About Node.js</a
            >
            he rambled about everything he thinks is wrong with Node, and the
            fact it was too late to fix them meant that he decided to start a
            new project called Deno (Which is an anagram and alphabetized
            version of the word Node).
          </p>
          <h3>Things I'm glad are fixed</h3>
          <p>
            First of all, there's no such thing as a package manager, instead
            you link DIRECTLY to the .js file that you want to use, Pretty neat
            eh?, it's just like developing in the browser. plus this discourages
            the appearance of another left-pad fiasco happening, and this
            renders using a super small library hard to do instead of just
            copy-pasting to a utils file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, first class support for Modern JavaScript. ESM Modules,
            TypeScript, Promises and Async/Await, etc
          </p>
          <p>
            Third, since first-class JavaScript support is in Deno, there's no
            need for complex tooling that has a billion abstractions on it, just
            do <span class="highlight">deno run</span>. Which means no Babel or
            any of that nonsense.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fourth, you might be thinking, all of this?, you might need more
            than 1 binary, Well guess what?, There's only ONE binary, everything
            is contained in 1 binary, including the TypeScript compiler!
          </p>
          <p>
            Fifth, None of those legacy Node.js crap that's been there for
            years, all of Deno is clean fresh new code that's confined to
            JavaScript's Standard, plus a couple of features.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            I really hope Deno takes off as THE JavaScript runtime because it is
            just a huge improvement over Node in so many ways.
          </p>
