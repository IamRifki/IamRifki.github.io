          <h3>Preface</h3>
          <p>
            When I say write open source code for free to any of my IRL friends
            or family, they always say,
          </p>
          <p class="quote">
            "Why do you code for free, can't you profit from it by selling it
            and making it closed sourced?"
          </p>
          <p>
            I simply laughed and say "It's the joy of programming that matters
            most", then they get confused and ask "What is the joy of
            programming?"
          </p>
          <h3>Joyous Programming</h3>
          <p>
            The joy of programming comes to this, are you happy or are enjoying
            yourself when you are programming?, this applies to both programming
            for business and for yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems like companies don't and won't recognize that programmers
            need to have joy in what they're making or they lose interest fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is very different to say Hobbyware projects
          </p>
          <p>
            Hobbyware is a term I use to describe software written by a couple
            of people with no other purpose than for fun and learning. most of
            my programs I write are like that.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is why most maintainers of FOSS projects still maintain code
            for free, because they have fun while programming, although, sadly
            companies are taking advantage of open source by using their code
            commercially and not giving back a single nickel or contribution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back to Topic.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason why I still love releasing my code for free is because I
            want to have fun, and help other people learn programming and have
            fun their way.
          </p>
          <p>
            To me, it's a win-win for sure, I don't have any hate towards closed
            source software, because they exist for a reason, and you shouldn't
            force people to open their code, but there's just this beauty that
            open source has that makes me want to keep opening my code, just the
            thought that I could help someone with something by opening my code
            is just wonderful.
          </p>
          <p>And that to me is the Joy of Programming, thank you very much.</p>
