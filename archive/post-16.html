            It's an old topic, but I felt the need to mention this again,
            Redesigns are done to move the app forward in time, if Discord kept
            its first design we wouldn't have dark mode, for instance.

              >This tweet by Jamie Kyle summarizes it perfectly</a
            >. I know there are actually pretty bad website redesigns that
            really tarnish the opinion on redesigns in general, but generally
            they're uncommon.

            I mostly think it's to do with people's mind not being used to new
            designs, Jonathan Blow, one of my inspirations, once gave a talk
            about why he redoes code a lot, he says it's to avoid code rot, I'm
            now gonna tke the idea of "code rot" and apply it to design, by
            stripping down and rebuilding UI and UX that are subpar or allout
            awful. A term I'm going to call "Sledgehammer Design".
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a website design that is broken, mobile unfriendly, etc.
            I recommend grabbing the sledgehammer and start redesigning it from
            scratch, but as always, keep in mind design guidelines.
