                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    The Ring menu system was an innovative menu system. It was first made in 1969 with the PIXIE system.
                    In 1986, Mike Gallaher and Don Hopkins together independently arrived at the concept of a context
                    menu based on the angle to the origin where the exact angle and radius could be passed as parameters
                    to a command, or the radius could be used to trigger a submenu. The Action RPG video game Secret of
                    Mana popularized the menu system, featuring an innovative icon-based ring menu in 1993. Its ring meu
                    system was adopted by later video games.
                </p>
                <h3>Usage</h3>
                <p>
                    For novice users, ring menus are easy because they are a self-revealing gestural interface: They
                    show what you can do and direct you how to do it. By clicking and popping up a ring menu, looking at
                    the labels, moving the pointer in the desired direction, then clicking to make a selection, users
                    learn the menu and practice the gesture to "mark ahead" ("mouse ahead" in the case of a mouse, "wave
                    ahead" in the case of a dataglove). With a little practice, it becomes quite easy to mark ahead even
                    through nested ring menus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the expert, ring menus are more efficient. Because they might have built up the muscle memory
                    for certain menu actions, and are able to select the option they want without looking the pop up
                    selections. In some cases, only when used more slowly like a traditional menu, does a ring menu pop
                    up on the screen, to reveal the available selections. Moreover, novices can gradually become experts
                    when they practice the same ring menu selection for many times and start to remember the menu and
                    the motion. As Jaron Lanier of VPL Research has remarked, "The mind may forget, but the body
                    remembers." Ring menus take advantage of the body's ability to remember muscle motion and direction,
                    even when the mind has forgotten the corresponding symbolic labels.
                </p>
                <h3>Comparison with other menu systems</h3>
                <p>
                    Ring menus are faster and more reliable to select from than linear menus, because selection depends
                    on direction instead of distance. The circular menu slices are large in size and near the pointer
                    for fast interaction. Experienced users use muscle memory without looking at the menu while
                    selecting from it. Nested ring menus can efficiently offer many options, and some ring menus can pop
                    up linear menus, and combine linear and radial items in the same menu. ring menus just like any
                    popup menu are shown only when requested, resulting in less visual distraction and cognitive load
                    than toolbars and menu bars that are always shown.
                </p>
                <h3>Why is it so important?</h3>
                <p>
                    The ring menu system as noted above, is easier to navigate and more reliable to select than other
                    menu types. I'm taking an example from the Paper Mario series. Take how The Thousand Year Door's
                    Battle Menu navigation is compared to the latest entry, Color Splash.

                    The Thousand Year Door uses a ring menu system similar to Secret of Mana's, from what I've seen and
                    felt, The Thousand Year Door's ring system is easy to navigate, practical and very reliable. Color
                    Splash however uses a clunky card linear menu system, that from what I've used and read online, is
                    clunky as heck.

                    As you can see the Ring menu made some games less clunky, however that does not mean that the Ring
                    menu is perfect for everything. Ring menus are most suited for actions that have been laid out by
                    humans, and have logical grouping choices. Linear menus are most suited for dynamic, large menus
                    that have many possible options, without any logical grouping, since ring menus can only show a
                    limited number of menu items.
