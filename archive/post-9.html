                <h3>Preface</h3>
                <p>
                    Today I'll be talking about Emulator Development, my experience with it, etc. This is not a
                    technical article by any means.
                </p>
                <h3>Hello EmuDev!</h3>
                <p>
                    Back in late 2018 I dreamt of making an Emulator, specifically a Nintendo Entertainment System
                    emulator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many have done it, but I would like to make my own. So in January 2019 I started working on my own
                    emulator, it wasn't for the NES, it was a CHIP-8 Emulator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CHIP-8 wasn't really a "console", it's more like a Virtual Machine, so the better way of saying
                    it, is a CHIP-8 Interpreter. I wrote mine originally in C++, but quickly gave up after seeing how
                    absurdly complex C++ truly is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later, I found the D Programming language. which promises to deliver a C/C++ like language with
                    modern features, I got hooked. so I basically copied someone else's emulator, studied it, and then
                    tried reimplementing it my way, and it worked pretty well. Sadly I've lost the code to this emulator
                    (I didn't make any backups or have a mirror), so it is lost to time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CHIP-8 was the only "major" project I've done in D that I completed, I have never finished
                    anything in D ever again.
                </p>
                <h3>Introducing the NES</h3>
                <p>
                    I started working on a NES emulator in D in March 2019. I think it went until it runs a couple of
                    test ROMs without a PPU, but as it turns out I didn't like D very much (The Standard Library was a
                    mess, they're currently rewriting it as we speak).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I jumped from D to C then to C++, and then finally Golang. Go was a language I tried in January
                    2019, but didn't really resonated with me until I tried it out again for a bigger project (such as a
                    NES emulator). It was simple, it had a better garbage collector than D, and my god it was wonderful,
                    I finished the emulator and I've now released it in GitHub with a 0BSD license, you can find it <a
                        href="https://github.com/IamRifki/flogNES">here</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>The RIIR epidemic</h3>
                <p>
                    Right before I finished my NES emulator in Go, I had found out about the Rust programming language,
                    and oh boy did i bit hard into that language. I rewrote the code in Rust (non-idiomatic though
                    because it was a sloppy Go to Rust translation), eventually I gave up on the RIIR, and switched back
                    to Go.
                </p>
                <h3>The SNES</h3>
                <p>
                    The SNES is my favorite console. after completing my months long journey to make a NES emulator, I
                    took a few weeks break, and started working on a SNES emulator, I initially started with C, but
                    decided to give Rust another shot. it went much better as it was more idomatic rust (sadly, I still
                    had to deal with the constraints that Rust has). there's not much to talk about it, it actually went
                    faster than the creation of my NES emulator (I exclusively focused on it for 2 months, my advice,
                    don't do that). anyway, the code's public <a href="https://github.com/IamRifki/s-econd-nes">here</a>
                    under MIT.
                </p>
                <h3>The Future</h3>
                <p>
                    I currently have no plans to revisit EmuDev in the near future, but I recently had an idea to make a
                    Dynamic Recompiler for the Gameboy (Like Corn N64 and andrewrk's Jamulator). but until that's
                    realized, I'll be working on Games and Websites.
