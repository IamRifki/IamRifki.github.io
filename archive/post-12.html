          <h3>Preface</h3>
          <p>
            When someone asked me what was my first programming language, I say
            LOGOS, but I didn't really do much in that language other than
            drawing shapes using the turtle command. The first language I ever
            actually did even a hello world program in was a Scheme dialect (Not
            sure which version of Scheme it was, maybe it was even an early
            version of Racket, but I digress), I basically now say to people
            that Scheme was my first programming language, not because I hate
            LOGOS, but because I never actually did any programming in it.
          </p>
          <h3>Discovering Scheme</h3>
          <p>
            I was in 5th Grade when my IT teacher talked about us making a
            simple program using a language called Scheme, it was very simple,
            it's basically a FizzBuzz program, but I remembered really liking
            it, my classmates didn't share my enthusiasm, but that's okay, as
            long as I had fun, that's all that matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later I made some more complex programs like a Calculator in Scheme,
            but I didn't remember if I went beyond that, like I said, I don't
            think it was even Scheme maybe it was Racket?, not sure really. If
            it was racket I would've made some visual programs, but I don't
            remember if I ever made one.
          </p>
          <h3>My IT Teacher</h3>
          <p>
            You can probably guess that my teacher was a fan of lisps (LOGOS was
            also a Lisp disguised as a BASIC), I mean if not, why would she
            teach Lisps to her students, Last I heard from her, she retired from
            teaching, and they're now teaching students Python there, which is a
            fine language, but sadly that's one less way for kids to get into
            Lisps.
          </p>
          <h3>Rediscovering the Magic</h3>
          <p>
            In Late-2019 I stumbled upon a book, it was my elementary school
            computer class notebook, I immediately got curious.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I opened it, I found a lot of me writing about old programs
            that are now defunct (remember Google Sketchup?). but I then gazed
            my eyes, on a program that I wrote as a child, a FizzBuzz
            implementation in Scheme. It's hardly readable when I take a photo
            of it so I'm just gonna put it in a code block.
          </p>
          <div class="code-body">
            <pre><span class="code-block-title">Scheme</span><code class="lolight">(do ((n 1 (+ n 1)))
  ((> n 100))
  (display
    (cond ((= 0 (modulo n 15)) "FizzBuzz!")
          ((= 0 (modulo n 3))  "Fizz!")
          ((= 0 (modulo n 5))  "Buzz!")
          (else n)))
    (newline))</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            I ran this in my Scheme interpreter and when I saw it working,
            flashed back to when I first wrote it, man that was fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            So yeah, for the past few weeks I've been working on trivial
            programs in Scheme, sadly I won't be doing anything major soon
            because of school, but I may try to make a Discord Bot using Racket
            since
            <a href="https://github.com/nitros12/racket-cord">this exists</a>.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            And that's about it, I suppose, it's been fun writing programs in
            Scheme for a while now. I have a question for you, What was your
            first programming language?, and what does it feel like when you
            tried it?, ping @altOverflow on Twitter so I can see your response.
          </p>
