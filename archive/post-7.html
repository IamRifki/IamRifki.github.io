                    Hello everyone, I'm officially coming out as Transgender. It may be a surprise for some but I feel
                    like I need to address some potential questions.
                </p>
                <h3>When did you realize that you were Transgender?</h3>
                <p>
                    I think it started back in elementary when I was visiting a hotel, I saw people wearing swimsuits (I
                    was told to look away), but I felt like I wanted to wear them, for some reason.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then a few months later during the final examination, I was asked to fill out a form about if I'm
                    fine with god making me a boy or something, I wrote that I was okay with it, but for some reason, I
                    feel like I was lying to myself, I ignored that feeling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my teenaged years, I honestly didn't really felt comfortable about my body, I managed to curb the
                    feeling, but sometimes I really wished I had a feminine one instead, I never told my parents about
                    this and I felt like they would banish me from the house.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of this caused a ton of Dysphoria and I feel like I need to get it off my chest.
                </p>
                <h3>Will you do HRT/Sex Change Surgery?</h3>
                <p>
                    I honestly do not know, I do not want to burden my parents even more and I'm really afraid of the
                    disastrous <b>permanent</b> consequences it could have.
                </p>
                <h3>Are you really sure you're Transgender?</h3>
                <p>
                    I can never be sure. I feel like I'm Non-binary leaning towards female, I can never be 100% sure.
                    but based on what I perceive myself, I think I'm Transgender.
                </p>
