                <h3>Preface</h3>
                <p>
                    Hello everyone, today's post is ramble of mine about how I view programs and programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="error">DISCLAIMER</span>: I do not claim to be some language theorist or an amazing
                    programmer, I'm just a person who's finding their way into programming, and their views on it.
                </p>
                <h3>Ramble</h3>
                <p>
                    In my view, Programming is nothing but a tool to solve a problem that I have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's several parts to <span class="highlight">programming</span>. Understanding the hardware,
                    understanding languages, and
                    developing ways to solve problems effectively like in mathematics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is fundamentally a program?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Algorithms + Data Structures = Program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When <span class="highlight">programming</span>, you need to understand the <span
                        class="highlight">purpose</span> of what you are doing it for.
                    If you then understand the <span class="highlight">purpose</span>, then you need to understand how
                    it should
                    <span class="highlight">function</span>. If you then understand its <span
                        class="highlight">function</span>, then you need to know how it will be
                    <span class="highlight">used</span>. If you then understand its <span
                        class="highlight">usage</span>, then you can worry about the
                    <span class="highlight">implementation or form</span> of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of my time is not <span class="highlight">programming</span> code, what I called the <span
                        class="highlight">implementation</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of my time are dealt with the previous aspects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Purpose -> Function -> Usage -> Form. Understand this, and its direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You cannot start anywhere.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Again, this is just a ramble of mine and shouldn't really be used as a reference on how to code,
                    then again, some of the people I look up to follow this principle, and it worked for them so, I
                    guess I'll follow in their footsteps.
                </p>
