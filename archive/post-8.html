                <h3>Preface</h3>
                <p>
                    Hey I'm back with another article. Let's talk about Nim.
                </p>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    According to Wikipedia:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <div class="code-body">
                        <pre> Nim (formerly named Nimrod) is 
 an imperative, general-purpose, multi-paradigm, 
 statically typed, systems, compiled programming language</pre>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was created by Andreas Rumpf. who I have mixed feelings about which I will touch later. this
                    language compiles to C/C++/JavaScript among others.
                </p>
                <h3>when isMainModule:</h3>
                <p>
                    Let's dive into Nim a bit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="error">NOTE:</span> I did not use any features extensively that can't be sanely use
                    without the Nim garbage collector (yes, Nim has a Garbage Collector, I'll get into that soon.)
                </p>
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                <p>
                    Ah, Syntax, My favorite part of language design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you do not know. I have mixed feelings about Pythonic Syntaxes. I think they're fine for small
                    scripts, but for huge programs, it can be a mess just to find an indentation error. Nim tries to fix
                    this by allowing you to also but explicit <span class="highlight">()</span>s, but that's largely
                    discouraged by the community, and I'm pretty sure the compiler just ignores that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Nim, you define types, A LOT. heck the way you make structs is using the <span
                        class="highlight">object</span> keyword. which is (you guessed it), defined inside of a <span
                        class="highlight">type</span> Which isn;t really a bad thing, I think it's perfectly fine, but
                    to some people it may be insanity. it uses <span class="highlight">camelCase</span>, I prefer <span
                        class="highlight">snake_case</span> but whatever, I do not really care.
                </p>
                <h3>Useful Features</h3>
                <p><span class="highlight">Defer</span></p>
                <p>
                    Defer Statements?!, really?, oh my god. <span class="highlight">defer</span> in Go and Odin, or
                    <span class="highlight">scope(exit)</span> in D. is a god send, they're much nicer (in my opinion)
                    than using RAII or try..finally clauses. when I discovered that Nim has these, I was immediately
                    hooked. it's such a useful feature.
                </p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Seq</span></p>
                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">Seq</span>uences are an interesting take for Dynamic Arrays. especially
                    since this language compiles to C. Regular "fixed" arrays are available too. Sadly if you want to
                    avoid the garbage collector, you might not want to use this feature as it does need some GC things.
                </p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Macros</span></p>
                <p>
                    Macros in Nim are really nice, They feel more like Lisp/Rust Macros than the C preprocessor. I
                    recommend <a href="https://nim-by-example.github.io/macros/">clicking here</a> for examples (C.W.
                    OOP).
                </p>
                <h3>The Garbage Collector</h3>
                <p>
                    The garbage collector in Nim has a few variations. For example, the stop-the-world, shared heap garbage collector
                    similar to Go's garbage collector (Which is a very good garbage collector mind you, I barely
                    have to think about it). however you can disable the garbage collector with the
                    <span class="highlight">--gc:none</span> option. Sadly this seems to be looked down upon by the
                    community except for the some people who use Nim for embedded systems.
                </p>
                <h3>The Community</h3>
                <p>
                    The community (for the most part) are nice, but they can be assertive on what you do. for example
                    when I was asking how can I use Nim without garbage collection. I did not get any useful answers and
                    instead was asked to use the experimental <span class="highlight">ARC</span> "memory management
                    strategy" by the community and Andreas Rumpf himself. it wasn't until <a
                        href="https://exelo.tl/">exelotl</a> actually gave an answer to my question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In case if you're curious, this is the answer they gave.
                    <div class="code-body">
                        <pre> Basically with gc:none you just wanna avoid all these features:
     - seq
     - ref / ref object
     - string  (use cstring instead)
     - closures / anonymous procedures 
     (if you wanna pass functions around, use {.nimcall.}, or {.nodecl.} if you wanna guarantee C compatibility)

 you might want to annotate all your object types with {.bycopy.} just for sanity 
 (apparently the compiler can choose to implicitly pass objects by reference if they get too big, though I've never actually experienced this)
 
 it's OK to use seqs and strings and closures in macros though
 just don't let them get into your runtime code</pre>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Overall, I think Nim has a lot of potential. I think the only thing I would change about it is its
                    Pythonic Syntax and make it nicer to work with <span class="highlight">--gc:none</span>. The community
                    could be better but the ones that are close to me are nice people, so thank you exelotl!. This is
