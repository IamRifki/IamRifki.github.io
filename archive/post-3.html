                <h3>Preface</h3>
                <p>
                    Hello everyone, today's post is another ramble of mine about language design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's like the title says, how languages define functions and why I find them interesting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I mainly find them interesting because of the many paradigms that programming languages have, a lot
                    of interesting ideas get thrown around and I'd like to explore some of them.
                </p>
                <h3>Examples</h3>
                <p>
                    Let's start off with good old <span class="highlight">C</span>:
                    <div class="code-body">

                        <pre><span class="code-block-title">C</span> <code class="lolight">void foo() {
    printf("bar");
}</code></pre>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For most programmers, nothing too unusual. The type is in front of the function name, then some
                    parenthesis if you want to add optional parameters, then an opening curly brace then the
                    function body then the closing brace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most C-like languages operate like this, so I won't be discussing them in detail. but I will give
                    some examples.
                </p>
                <div class="code-body">
                    <pre><span class="code-block-title">JavaScript</span> <code class="lolight">function foo() {
    console.log("bar");
}</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In JavaScript you see that the type is inferred and instead we use the <span
                        class="highlight">function</span> keyword.
                </p>
                <div class="code-body">
                    <pre><span class="code-block-title">Python</span> <code class="lolight">def foo():
    print("bar")</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In Python the type is also inferred but since python uses indentation instead of braces, the
                    function is defined with the start of a <span class="highlight">:</span>.
                </p>
                <span class="error">NOTE:</span> Some programmers argue that Python is not "C-like", but for the
                sake of this article, let's just say it is
                <div class="code-body">
                    <pre><span class="code-block-title">Zig</span> <code class="lolight">fn foo() void {
    std.debug.warn("bar");
}</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Zig's way of defining syntax is strikingly similar to how C does it, with only a few differences,
                    with the type being behind the opening brace, and an additional <span class="highlight">fn</span>
                    keyword.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's move to something less like C.
                </p>
                <div class="code-body">
                    <pre><span class="code-block-title">Clojure</span> <code class="lolight">(defn foo
    [& args]
    (println "bar"))</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Ah, Clojure, alright.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In practically all Lisps, everything is contained in parentheses, In Clojure,
                    we first do an opening parenthesis, then the <span class="highlight">defn</span> keyword, after that
                    the name of the function, then the function arguments, then we get to the function block, which is
                    straightforward, it prints <span class="highlight">"bar"</span>, and it starts and ends
                    with another pair of parentheses, then the closing parenthesis, ending the function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wow, that was hefty, sorry if you got bored, my writing skills aren't that great ðŸ™ƒ
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's move on to the final 2 Languages: Haskell and Oberon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's start with Haskell:
                </p>
                <div class="code-body">
                    <pre><span class="code-block-title">Haskell</span> <code class="lolight">foo = do
    putStrLn "bar"</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    As a functional language, Functions are Haskell's main focus (obviously), nothing too remarkable, I
                    would explain it, but I do feel it's self-explanatory, if you want a good code example of Haskell, I
                    recommend <a href="https://dev.to/gefjon/a-simple-haskell-program-1h0a">this article</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time for Oberon.
                </p>
                <div class="code-body">
                    <pre><span class="code-block-title">Oberon</span> <code class="lolight">PROCEDURE foo*;
BEGIN
    Out.Open;
    Out.String("bar");
END</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In Oberon, functions are called <span class="highlight">procedures</span>, which in all honesty is a
                    better name. Some programmers may notice that the language looks a bit like PASCAL, that is because
                    the language was created by the same person, Niklaus Wirth.
                    We first start the procedure by typing <span class="highlight">PROCEDURE</span> then the procedure
                    name then a <span class="highlight">*</span> then a <span class="highlight">;</span>, then we <span
                        class="highlight">BEGIN</span>, open the output, then we output the string <span
                        class="highlight">"bar"</span>, after all of that, we end the procedure.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    I hope this article helped you understand why I find this all interesting, different spoken
                    languages do different things, same with programming languages, they may have similarities, but most
                    of them have differences in some way, and that concludes the article, I hope to see you next time.
