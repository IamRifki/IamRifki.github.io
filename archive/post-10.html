                <h3>Preface</h3>
                <p>
                    Software Licenses are an interesting Topic to me because everyone seems to have different ideas on
                    what licenses you should use in a project. Now, I'm not a lawyer, so don't ask me for legal help.
                    This article won't even touch on Legality very much, just the on going debate between permissive
                    licenses, public domain licenses (Like MIT and CC0), and Copyleft Licenses (Like GPLv3).
                </p>
                <h3>Public Domain Licenses</h3>
                <p>
                    Let's start with the least powerful licenses. Public Domain Licenses, This includes: Unlicense, CC0,
                    and 0BSD (Although you can add a copyright notice to 0BSD, you can <a
                        href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-0-clause-license"> remove it legally</a>, if you want).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="error">NOTE:</span> No, I do not count the WTFPL as a license as it was never tested in
                    court.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think from these groups 0BSD is the best license to choose. Unlicense is basically a poem someone
                    wrote and to my knowledge isn't legal in countries where the public domain doesn't exist as it does
                    not have a backup clause for those countries. CC0 has a backup clause, but it is not recommended for
                    software by the FSF and the OSI because it does not grant patent licenses. 0BSD fixes all of these
                    by having a clear and short license and have patent licenses.
                </p>
                <h3>Here comes Permissive FOSS</h3>
                <p>
                    The Permissive FOSS licenses are the ones I recommend to people to use, they're usually short and
                    simple (Screw you Apache). There are lots of them, but the ones I recommend are MIT, BSD 2-clause
                    or 3-clause, Zlib (If you don't want people to redistribute your code with the same name), and the
                    more recent <a href="https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0">Blue Oak Model License</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't really have one recommended license as every project has its own needs, I personally use MIT
                    for my projects, and that's about it. I'd say, Zlib is better if you don't want to get a fork with
                    the same name, confusing people.
                </p>
                <h3>Copyleft</h3>
                <p>
                    Copyleft licenses are the ones I avoid, but I do know why they're made. basically every FOSS fanboy
                    I've talked to say that "Every software should be open source under GPL or GTFO", completely stupid
                    I know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When people say "Copyleft software licenses", they're usually referring to the GPLs, which consist
                    of LGPL, GPL, and AGPL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    LGPL is the least powerful, and is the one I recommend to people. it allows people to reuse your
                    code under a different license, which is nice so that other people can actually use your code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, if you're Richard Stallman or one of his "believers" you probably advocate for GPL or
                    AGPL as they "force companies to make their code OSS", of course, this has the side effect of making
                    other people's ALREADY PUBLIC CODE, also have to be under the GPL. In my opinion, this is bollocks,
                    If you're making a library for something, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND using LGPL or a permissive license
                    over GPL, because fuck RMS and fuck his followers.
                </p>
                <h3>License Zero</h3>
                <p>
                    I do not know what category <a href="https://licensezero.com/">License Zero</a> fits in, it
                    certainly seems like a good idea in my opinion. You can choose to allow your source code/library to
                    be used by certain types of
                    people, which to me, is much better than what the GPL and RMS is doing. It's an actual license
                    that I want to use instead of the mess that the GPL gives us, I recommend using this if you do not
                    want to use the licenses I recommend before.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    If you do not agree with anything or disagree with my recommendations/statements, that is okay, we
                    all have different opinions after all, again, I would like you to not take any of this as absolute
                    truth, as I am not a lawyer, nor am I studying for a law degree. and with that, that's the
                    conclusion, thank you for reading this long.
