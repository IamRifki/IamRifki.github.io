          <h3>Preface</h3>
          <p>
            First of all, I don't hate FOSS (if that were the case I wouldn't
            have released some of my code on GitHub), but SOME people (like
            <a href="https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV/issues/7"
              >this mob</a
            >) irritate me beyond end. These people (Whom I will call
            FOSSnatics) are easily the worst, they're worse than RIIRers (I
            really mean it), and good god I'm so glad my dumb young-self didn't
            become one of them (well, I almost became them at one point).
          </p>
          <a
            href="http://unhandledexpression.com/general/2018/11/27/foss-is-free-as-in-toilet.html"
            ><h3>Free as in toilet</h3></a

            Software needs maintenance, and it just so happens that managing a
            large FOSS project can get really really ugly. From "clean coders",
            RIIR people, and worst of all (like the mob I linked earlier)
            Stallmanists. Stallmanists are a subset of FOSSnatics who want all
            code to be under the GPLv3 license (<a
              href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/20/01/24/2211238/free-software-foundation-suggests-microsoft-upcycle-windows-7-as-open-source"
              >and of course they make a COMPLETE fool out of themselves</a
            >). So not only do FOSS maintainers have to deal with all of that
            (and more), they have to also do their job as programmers (well,
            FOSS maintainers aren't always programmers from what I've seen, but
            most of them, anyway) and spend time maintaining, updating, adding
            new features, while getting almost nothing in return (unless if they
            have a patreon or OpenCollective). A Fortune 500 company starred
            your repo?, well too bad, you're not getting everything more than
            that, LOL.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why people are afraid of releasing their code as FOSS, I
            don't blame them either, Closed source maintenance is saner than the
            FOSS circus (at least in my experience and the people I talked to's
            experiences).
          </p>
          <h3>Fuck you, pay me</h3>
          <p>
            About Fortune 500 companies not paying for that software, that has
            been the trump card of anti-FOSS people (Like Casey Muratori) for a
            while now. Sadly it is a real thing, Fortune 500 companies use
            people's FOSSware for completely free while not giving back a single
            nickel or contribution. some Stallmanists may now think that the
            solution is GPLv3, but I'm going to discuss why it isn't.
          </p>
          <h3>Stallmanists</h3>
          <p>
            I discussed Stallmanists a bit in a previous section. But I want to
            talk about them a bit more. I believe that they are the worst people
            in the god damn software world. and they are everywhere preaching
            companies to release their code as GPLv3. People who say that
          </p>
          <p class="uwu">
            Companyies awe the wowst entities in the wowwd, they'we puwe eviw
            and we shouwd make ouw wicense to powew the peopwe and make
            companyies go bankwupt"
          </p>
          <p>
            are delusional, although I still don't like the idea of
            multi-national companies using FOSS to spy on people, they're not as
            bad as say Chinese Black Hats.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do not believe that the GPL license helps anyone, In my opinion,
            it lessens the power the author has over their software. I know
            there's a "death to the author" saying in literature, but it does
            not apply to software considering software is very real and not
            fictional.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can see my
            <a href="./post-10.html"
              >previous article about software licenses</a
            >
            and why I think permissive licenses are the way to go (for most
            people). I think a better solution for this conundrum would be a
            <a href="https://licensezero.com/">license zero</a>-like license
            that restricts use of For-Profit use of your code.
          </p>
          <h3>FOSS "Magic"</h3>
          <p class="uwu">
            Oh, ho, ho <br />
            It's magic you know <br />
            Never believe, it's not so
          </p>
          <p>
            People often rave about how FOSS is just magic, how it just works,
            how the "evil" closed source is harder to use and shit, the thing is
            though, the Open/Closeness of the software DOESN'T MATTER. GIMP is
            significantly worse than Photoshop in my and several designer's
            experience, the thing that makes software in general seems magical
            is how the code is well, programmed. there's little to no corelation
            of FOSS software being better just because it's open source, Blender
            took ages for it to be good, maybe it got good faster than Maya, but
            I'm not sure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Point is, it doesn't matter if it's closed or open, I use what
            works, and so should you.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            If you do not agree with anything or disagree with my
            recommendations/statements, that is okay, we all have different
            opinions after all, I would like you to not take any of this as
            absolute truth, It's my own experience and research that led to this
            article being written.
